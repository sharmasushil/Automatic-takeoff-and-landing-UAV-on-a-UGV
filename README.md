## Automatic-takeoff-and-landing-UAV-on-a-UGV

The aim of this work is the control of a quadrotor with the goal of spatial stabilization.Stability is of great importance when mounting additional devices such as HD camera, transmitter and dipole antenna in the drone. The control approach searches for the autonomy of the robot taking into account internal sensors. The vision-based method is chosen for landing target detection.

By computer vision, we estimate the relative position of the quadrotor and then further control and its automatic landing. For the automatic landing of the system consisting of node.js, which allows our autonomous system to use some specific modules. An OpenCV algorithm is developed to estimate a the relative position and orientation of a quadrotor using the landpad marker that has the black and white circle called the Oriental Roundel. Finally, some tests are performed on the simulator in which an automatic landing of the frame is achieved. An automatic take-off and landing algorithm, we have implemented node.js to make a mission successful in a short time. The copter node programming libraries must manage the drone. The drone is able to track a mobile robot independently at a constant speed and land on it.
